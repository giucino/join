                <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here,

                    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                    <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                        students as
                        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                        <br><br>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize
                        work,
                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of
                        kanban
                        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                        <br><br>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not
                        intended
                        for
                        extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
                        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
                        Join.

                <h2>How to use it</h2>

                <section class="info-section">
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
                    <div class="info-list">
                        <h2 class="info-index">1.</h2>

                            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                            <p>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                                and
                                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done". </p>

                            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                            <p>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                section,
                                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                                can
                                be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board. </p>

                            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                            <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual
                                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                                task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc. </p>

                            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                            <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                dragging
                                and dropping the card from one list to another. </p>

                            <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                            <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                Deleting a
                                card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                                cards,
                                as this action is irreversible.
                                <br><br>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and
                                your
                                team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
